\section*{Assignment 5}
% Password.
% Fpga was counting time ow long the responsetime was for responding, waiting for the 1st didgit of the answere. middelng the time between als answeres to get the longes one right. using thatone as correct didgit of the PW.
%
% building the counter 4 the clockcycles was the hard part strings where to long
% fpga giving back the time  we had to use 2 bytes
% 
% python did the rest.

Like in assignment 4, we get a microcontroller (we know, that its sowftware is written using the c programming language) and analyse it the same way as before. 
This time it directly prompts \textit{``Please enter password:''} and the goal is set. As possible attack vector comes a timing vulnerability to mind, if the password comparison is implemented using \texttt{strcmp}. We continue setting up the FPGA like before -- able to reset the device on command and relaying all communication. We just need a little further testing to be sure, that we are indeed going to program a timing attack.

Bruteforce attack against password string.
